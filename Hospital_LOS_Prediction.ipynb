        "\n",
        "Hospital management is a vital area that has garnered significant attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. The inefficient distribution of resources, such as beds and ventilators, can potentially lead to numerous complications. However, this issue can be mitigated by accurately predicting the length of stay (LOS) for patients prior to admission. Once this information is determined, the hospital can effectively plan appropriate treatment, allocate resources, and arrange staff accordingly to reduce LOS and enhance the chances of recovery. Additionally, the allocation of rooms and beds can be optimized based on these predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to its inefficient management system, HealthPlus hospital has experienced substantial financial losses and loss of life. They have encountered difficulties in equitably allocating equipment, beds, and hospital staff. Implementing a system capable of estimating the length of stay (LOS) for patients could significantly address this problem."

Furthermore, the project aims to derive meaningful insights and develop policies from the data to assist the hospital in improving its healthcare infrastructure and increasing revenue."
